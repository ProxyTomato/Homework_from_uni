		<p>Plans for a new NHS health centre in a Lincolnshire town have been approved.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The Boston Integrated Health & Care Centre will be built on the site of the former B&M store in Rosegarth Street, which was demolished as part of the Rosegarth Square redevelopment.</p>
		<br>
		<p>It will include a pharmacy, library, community dental services and clinical services.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Health officials said it would help to tackle health inequalities by providing early care and intervention for patients.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The application was assessed by local organisations including the county council, Anglian Water and the Environment Agency, none of which raised any objections.</p>
		<br>
		<p>However, according to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/lnp/ldrs">the Local Democracy Reporting Service</a>, Historic England raised concerns over the impact "to the setting" of the town's conservation area.</p>
		<br>
		<p>However, Boston Borough Council said the proposal would provide "significant public and social benefits to the area", adding it complied with planning policies.</p>
